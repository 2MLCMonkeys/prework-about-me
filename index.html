      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I currently am volunteering at a horse farm, anytime I am not there I am a stay at home mom for my two children. I have been working with horses the past 15 years and prior to this year was a barn manager.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Southern New Hampshire</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Horses... I have lived, slept, and breathed horses most my life. Otherwise I spend most my time absorbed in doing things with my kids and what down time I manage at night, its competitive gaming to unwind.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Have a career I can learn, grow, and build myself as a person and a professional to have a sustainable life for myself and my kids.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Ruther Glen, Virginia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development is something that I have already played with sporadically and self taught myself the basics when I was younger. I did it for fun and always enjoyed it. I never thought I could use it as a career path until a family member did so and suggested it to me. I would love to combine what I already find interesting within my career path and be able to just enjoy my passion for horses outside of that, since for years I have only pursued a career with horses.</p>
